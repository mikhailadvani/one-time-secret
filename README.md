# one-time-secret

One-time-secret is a utility to share passwords securely. It is not designed to be a shared password manager but a mechanism to share one-off passwords like password resets.

## Working

* On creation of a secret, the contents are written to a pre-configured S3 bucket to a random location generated by UUID.
* The UUID is returned as part of the response.
* This UUID is used to retrieve the secret.
* On retrieval, the secret is also deleted from S3.

## Configuring

The following configuration parameters can be provided the tool through environment variables.

* `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where the bucket resides.
* `BUCKET_NAME`: The name of the S3 bucket to use as a backend for secrets.
* `S3_PREFIX`: The key prefix (S3 folder) under which you would like to have all the secrets stored. Default: `""`
* `S3_OBJECT_ACL`: The canned-acl to be applied to the secret file. Default: `"bucket-owner-full-control"`. There shouldn't be a need to change this but in case you do in a special scenario, it can be configured using this parameter.

## IAM permissions required

## Lambda setup

## Running of a custom domain

## Gotcha's

* In case the one-time-secret app authenticates with AWS through an account different than one where the bucket is stored, PutObjectAcl privileges will also be required to ensure clean ownership of objects.
* Versioning: Ensure that versioning is disabled on the bucket which is being used as a backend of the one-time-secret, otherwise deleted objects can be retrieved.
* Lifecycle policies: It is recommended to have an aggressive lifecycle policy applied to the bucket. This is a safety net to ensure that in case the deletion during retrieval fails for whatever reason, the lifecycle policy deletion will kick in to delete the contents.
* Since this is written in GoLang and the AWS sdk-for-go has a known bug related to cross account authentication, you might need to set the environment variable `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1`.
